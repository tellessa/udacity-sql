When using WITH, we can put the alias first, followed by AS and the subquery in parantheses
A single WITH keyword can be followed by multiple alias assignments (my term).
WITH statements are also called Common Table Expressions or CTE.
They serve the exact same purpose as subqueries.
They are more common in practice because they tend to be cleaner for the future reader to follow their logic.
Creating a CTE is a lot like moving complex logic into its own function then assigning the result of calling that function into a variable.
